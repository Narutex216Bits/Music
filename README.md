# Music
A little work on webpage to show my musical tastes, just a simple HTML page with some CSS work to make fancy cards rotation
with music albuns, after click on the album the link open a new tab in your browser to the music video in the image.
Good for showing your musical tastes on the web. The goal of the project is to do all of this without javascript.

Finally finished, you can grab and personalize to your taste!
